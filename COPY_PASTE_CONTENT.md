🔒 I created "Awesome Cybersecurity for Developers" - A curated list of security tools that actually fit into development workflows

Hey r/programming! 👋

As a developer who's been frustrated by security tools that are either too complex for daily use or aimed at security professionals rather than developers, I created a comprehensive resource list focused specifically on **developer-friendly cybersecurity tools**.

## What makes this different from other security lists?

🎯 **Developer-First Approach**: Every tool is selected based on how well it integrates into development workflows
🔧 **IDE Integration**: Includes plugins and extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, etc.
📦 **CI/CD Ready**: Tools that work seamlessly in automated pipelines
🚀 **Modern Stack**: Focus on containers, APIs, and cloud-native security
📚 **Learning Path**: From beginner to advanced, with hands-on resources

## What's included (50+ resources):

- **SAST Tools**: Semgrep, Bandit, Brakeman, MobSF
- **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy, OSV-Scanner
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks, detect-secrets
- **Container Security**: Trivy, Clair, Grype
- **API Security**: OWASP ZAP, Nuclei
- **IDE Plugins**: Security extensions for popular editors
- **Secure Coding Guides**: Language-specific best practices (Python, JS, Java, Go, C#)
- **OWASP Top 10 Guide**: Prevention strategies with code examples
- **Learning Resources**: From WebGoat to advanced courses

## Quality Assurance:
✅ All tools verified as actively maintained (2025)
✅ Automated link checking
✅ Consistent formatting and badges
✅ Community contribution guidelines

**Link**: https://github.com/100Psycho007/awesome-cybersecurity-for-developers

I'd love feedback from the community! What security tools do you use in your daily development? What am I missing?

New resource: "Awesome Cybersecurity for Developers" - Security tools from a development perspective

I've compiled a comprehensive list of cybersecurity resources specifically curated for developers and development teams.

Unlike general security tool lists, this focuses on:
- Tools that integrate into development workflows
- Secure coding practices by programming language
- DevSecOps pipeline integration
- Developer-friendly learning resources

The list includes 50+ verified tools across categories like SAST, SCA, secrets detection, container security, and API security.

All tools are verified as actively maintained and include practical implementation guidance.

Would appreciate feedback from the security community on what's missing or could be improved!

**Text:**
```
I've been frustrated by security tool lists that include enterprise solutions developers can't easily adopt, so I created a curated list focused specifically on developer-friendly cybersecurity tools.

The list includes 50+ tools across categories like SAST, dependency scanning, secrets detection, container security, and API security. What makes it different:

- Every tool is evaluated for development workflow integration
- Includes IDE plugins and CI/CD pipeline guidance  
- Language-specific secure coding practices (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C#)
- OWASP Top 10 guide with prevention strategies and code examples
- All tools verified as actively maintained in 2025

The goal is to make security more accessible to developers by focusing on tools that enhance rather than disrupt existing workflows.

Would love feedback from the HN community on what's missing or could be improved!
